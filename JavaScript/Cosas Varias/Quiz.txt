Variables are tools you can use to: Store data

Which of the following has the proper syntax for setting a variable?: var name = "name";

What happens when you call alert on a javascript variable like the following: alert(name) : it causes a pop up window to appear containing the data from the variable

You can define variables in JavaScript with var and also with : let

Which of the following is a JavaScript comment? : //

How would you do a quick check on what kind of data type it is you are working with? : typeof

With JavaScript what does "200" - 50 = ? : 150

With JavaScript what does "200" + 50 = ? : "20050"

2.
When comparing to see if 2 var are equal which of the following can be used : ==

While == works the better practice is to use === which is called : strict equal

To check if 2 variables are not equal you use which syntax : !=

"var age = 30; if (age <= 10) { console.log("You can eat from the kid's menu"); } else if (age >= 16 && age < 25) { console.log("You are old enough to drive"); } else if (age >= 25) { console.log("You are old enough to rent a car"); }, If you were to run this code, which conditional in this if/else statement would run?" : The second ELSE IF

"What is missing from the following code? var dataPoint = {}; ______ (typeof dataPoint) { case "string": console.log("It's a string"); break; case "number": console.log("It's a number"); break; case "boolean": console.log("It's a boolean"); break; default: console.log('No matches'); }" : switch

3.

Which of the following is the right syntax for an empty function with no params? : function hiThere () { }

Once you have set a function that has no arguments, which of the following is the correct syntax call : functionName ()

If you want to use the value of a function later on in your program, you use which call inside the function : return

With variable scope, if a variable is available to the entire program what scope is it in : global

With variable scope, if a variable is available only to the function it is in, what scope is it in : local

"The following is known as a function ______, var greeting = function () { return ""Hi there!""; };" : expression

If you are making functions inside of a code block, which type of function should you NOT use : function declaration

"Given the following function which of the following is the correct call. function fullName(firstName, lastName, language) { var language = language || 'English'; return firstName.toUpperCase() + "", "" + lastName.toUpperCase() + "" - "" + language; } " : console.log(fullName('Jordan', 'Hudgens', 'Spanish'));

4.

Which is the syntax for creating a literal array? : var literalArray = [1, 2, 3];

Which of the following is a mixed array? : [1, 2, "3", 4, "5"]

When you want to call the first element in an array what position number do you use? : 0

In the following nested array how would you call the 3rd element in the second array? array = [["a", "b", "c", "d"], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,], ["do", "ray", "me", "",]] : array[1][2];

Which syntax would remove an element from the following array? var arr = ['Altuve', 'Bregman', 'Correa', 'Springer']; : arr.pop();

Using the same array how would we add a new element to an array? var arr = ['Altuve', 'Bregman', 'Correa', 'Springer']; : arr.push('Bagwell');

Now that we have worked with the last element in an array, which syntax removes the FIRST element in the following array? var arr = ['Altuve', 'Bregman', 'Correa', 'Springer']; : arr.shift();

 Which syntax ADDS a new element to the beginning of the following array? var arr = ['Altuve', 'Bregman', 'Correa', 'Springer']; : arr.unshift('Kyle');

How would we remove the second element of the following array? var arr = ['Altuve', 'Bregman', 'Correa', 'Springer']; : arr.splice(1, 1);

If we did not know the element position in the array what is the syntax to find the element, and store it in a var? : var foundElement = arr.indexOf('Data we are looking for');

5.
Which of the following has the correct syntax for a simple for loop for this var, var players = [ 'Altuve', 'Bregman', 'Correa', 'Springer' ]; : for (var i = 0; i < players.length; i++) { console.log(players[i]); }

Which of the following is a use of for loops in JavaScript? : to iterate over data

Which of the following has the correct syntax for a simple for in loop for this var, var players = [ 'Altuve', 'Bregman', 'Correa', 'Springer' ]; : for (player in players) { console.log(players[player]); }

Which is the proper syntax for in loop for this Object, var student = { name: 'Kristine', age: 12, city: 'Scottsdale' };: for (var key in student) { console.log(key + " => " + student[key]); }

With while loops where would you declare this sentinel value? var i = 0; : outside of the loop

var i = 0; while (i < players.length) { console.log(players[i]); } If you ran this code as is, you would start _____: an infinite loop

What is the syntax to increment the following for each time the while loop runs, var i = 0; inside the code you will call ___: i++

The following is know as a _______ var i = 21; do { console.log(players[i]); i++; } while (i < players.length): do/while loop

A do while loop is guaranteed to run at least : once
